I'm optimizing the "follow the gap" algorithm for the F1-Tenth autonomous racing competition by generating all viable gaps, then comparing their trajectories to the car's original projected raceline.
The car will go through whichever gap results in the smallest deviation from its projected raceline to minimize its time.
